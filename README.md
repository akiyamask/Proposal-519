[Gif of your breadboard LED in action.]

As can be seen, the first gif is that we use the supply resource to lighten the LED light.

Then, we change the supply method to rp2040 and control the LED with the borad. As shown in the gif below. The LED in the board will shine at the same frequency with the LED on the breadboard.

[An outline of what you plan to build, and why you think itâ€™s cool.]

...Maybe what I plan to build, from the extent of what I handle through the class, is a simple system to control the LED lights. Just image that we can combine the lab1 sensor and the LED part, deciding which LED light to lighten and how it shines by gesture or light index... Anyway this is all the possible things that come to my mind. Maybe it is... cool?

[Components requested from Detkin (after confirming availability).]

Some simple components may be required like LEDs, transistors, resistors, supplies, wires, breadborads. 

[Any questions about your design or component selection.]

Of course the questions are inevitable but not yet, thus pending.
